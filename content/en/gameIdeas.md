## A classic. Tic Tac Toe

![tictactoe](https://toytheater.com/wp-content/uploads/tic_tac_toe.gif)

This would be fairly ok to build? I think. And it has a very simple rule so it doesn't take very long for a player to learn to play it. In fact, almost everyone (probably all the people that come to the exhibition would be able to play it immediately) can play it straightaway.

But it wont be fun and unique without any twist. Maybe an additional task before the person could put their sign at the board? Maybe rather than a straight line, we can make different "shape" instead? (A curve? A box??) Maybe for different shape then we also can increase the size of the board.

## Quick Math Game?

Something like a quick guessing game, but math. Given 2 number and a math operation (+, -, *, /), given several option, player must choose which one is the correct one, and the faster gets the point. Whoever reach 5 points first (maybe), wins the game.

## Avoid the obstacle running game(?)

So something like subway surfer or temple run, but created with very simple "graphics" (Leds only hahaha). So say something like 3 lanes, player have to avoid the obstable that keeps "going" down the screen, towards the player. Player also have 2 buttons to move left and right, then for every obstacle that the player pass, plus the score. More like a survival game? To see who can survive the longest. If somehow possible make it so that the "speed" becomes faster and faster.

## Whack a button!

A whack a mole but with buttons and leds? So when an led lights up, must press it / whack it! Maybe have something like buttons with leds? Something like this.  
<img src="https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/1200x900/491-00.jpg" alt="button led" width="250"/>

Every button that the player _whacked_ in time, player get some points. Highest point wins.
