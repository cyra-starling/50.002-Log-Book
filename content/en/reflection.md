# Overall Reflection

This project has taught me many things. I was blessed with good teammates too, so overall even though this project was alot of work, I had fun working on it! Even though the hardware debugging was not fun at all.

Things I learnt:  
1. I learnt that detailed planning on when to do parts of the project is very important. We did not really have a clear schedule and just work around the deadline, so sometimes we had to rush stuff to finish it before the checkoff, in which sometimes it took away our sleep time. But overall, it was a fun experience to build a game in which we designed.
2. I also learnt on how to code low level language (lucid) which requires a different perspective in mind than when using high level language like C#. It was a different perpspective in terms of how the ```always``` block is "always" happening like "wires" connecting the things written there, while using high level language means the code is executed line by line.


Many thanks to all professors and seniors who have helped me and my group in doing this project and learning to do this project. And also thanks to my group, Zack, Matthew, and Jia Yi who have made this project fun to do!
